When successful advertiser Gordon Comstock (Richard E. Grant) abruptly walks away from his career to pursue his dream of being a poet, his path is much more difficult than expected. At first encouraged by a prior publishing of his work, Comstock has trouble finding work, and soon financial problems begin to pile up. Also frustrating is that his former co-worker and girlfriend, Rosemary (Helena Bonham Carter), seems uninterested in sex, although she does stand by him despite his struggles.
